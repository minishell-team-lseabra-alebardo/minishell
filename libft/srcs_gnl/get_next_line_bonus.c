/**
 * @function get_next_line
 * @brief Reads the next line from a file descriptor, supporting multiple
 *        descriptors.
 *
 * The `get_next_line` function reads a single line from the given file
 * descriptor (`fd`). Unlike the standard implementation in `get_next_line.c`,
 * this version supports multiple file descriptors simultaneously by using an
 * array of static buffers, one for each file descriptor.
 *
 * @param fd The file descriptor to read from. Must be a valid, open file
 *           descriptor.
 * @return A pointer to a dynamically allocated string containing the next line,
 *         including the newline character (`\n`) if present. Returns `NULL` if:
 *         - The file descriptor is invalid.
 *         - `BUFFER_SIZE` is less than or equal to 0.
 *         - An error occurs during reading.
 *         - The end of the file is reached and no content is left to return.
 *
 * @details
 * - The function uses a static array of buffers (`buffer[1024]`) to handle
 *   multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
 * - Each file descriptor has its own buffer to store leftover data between
 *   calls.
 * - It reads from the file descriptor in chunks of size `BUFFER_SIZE`.
 * - Stops reading when a newline character (`\n`) is encountered or the end of
 *   the file is reached.
 * - Cleans up the buffer after extracting the line.
 *
 * @note
 * - The function is not thread-safe because it uses static buffers. If multiple
 *   threads call the function simultaneously, they may access or modify the same
 *   static buffer, leading to **undefined behavior**, such as data corruption or
 *   crashes.
 * - The caller is responsible for freeing the memory allocated for the returned
 *   line.
 * - If the file descriptor is closed or no more lines are available, the
 *   corresponding buffer is freed.
